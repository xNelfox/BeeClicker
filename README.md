The aim of the game is to click on cute bees to collect honey and score points. The more clicks, the more honey, and thus the ability to unlock new features, improvements and fascinating maps.


🎮 Gameplay:
Players start with a single bee on their tree stump, clicking on it to collect honey. Each click earns points that can be used to purchase upgrades that increase the bee's efficiency, the amount of honey collected or open new maps.

💸 Improvements:

🗺️ New Maps:
Discovering new maps is a key element of the game. Each map offers unique challenges and opportunities. You can collect honey in meadows, orchards and even in the forest, where you will meet new species of bees. Each map adds another layer of difficulty, and players must adapt their strategy to overcome each location's challenges.

🏔️ Graphics and Music:
The game is characterized by colorful, eye-friendly graphics, and each map has its own unique design. The background music adds atmosphere and maintains a positive mood while clicking the bees.
